# Spotify-music-website-clone-frontend-project
A music website clone frontend created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aims to replicate the look and functionality of an existing music website. HTML provides the structure and content of the web pages, CSS is used to style the interface, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. The clone may include features like displaying music albums, artist profiles, song lists, and playback controls. Users can browse and search for music, listen to songs, and navigate through the website similar to the original music site.
